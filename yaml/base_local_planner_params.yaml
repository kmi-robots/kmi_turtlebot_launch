# The following parameters are used by the local planner.
TrajectoryPlannerROS:

  # The following parameters set velocity bounds.
  # Note: the planner cannot plan to move backwards, so min_vel_x has to be
  # non-negative. It is better to set a value which is slightly above 0.
  # A positive minimum bound does not imply that the robot never stays still.
  max_vel_x: 0.5
  min_vel_x: 0.4
  max_vel_theta: 0.4
  min_vel_theta: -0.4
  min_in_place_vel_theta: 0.3
  sim_time: 1.5

  # The following parameters set acceleration bounds.
  # Low acceleration bounds mean that the planner lowers differences between
  # subsequent velocity commands, thus avoiding sudden moves.
  acc_lim_theta: 0.3
  acc_lim_x: 0.2

  # The following parameter states that path distance and goal distance are
  # expressed in meters instead of in cells.
  meter_scoring: true

  # States that the robot cannot move along the y axis (it cannot strafe).
  holonomic_robot: false

  # The following parameters set the tolerance in reaching the goal.
  # latch_xy_goal_tolerance states that if the robot reaches the goal xy
  # location it will simply rotate in place, even if it ends up outside the
  # goal by doing so. This limits the cases in which the robot keeps rotating
  # around the goal.
  xy_goal_tolerance: 0.20
  yaw_goal_tolerance: 0.30
  latch_xy_goal_tolerance: true

  # When the robot is too close to an obstacle it will "escape", meaning that
  # it will move with linear velocity given by escape_vel (which obviously 
  # must be negative).
